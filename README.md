# MQT QUBOMaker: Automatic Generation of QUBO Formulations from Optimization Problem Specifications

MQT QUBOMaker is a framework that can be used to automatically generate QUBO formulations for various optimization problems based on a selection of constraints that define the problem.
It is developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) as part of the _[Munich Quantum Toolkit](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/) (MQT)_.

The tool allows users to create QUBO formulations, and, thus, interact with quantum algorithms, without requiring any background knowledge in the field of quantum computing. End-users can stay entirely within their domain of expertise while being shielded from the complex and error-prone mathematical tasks of QUBO reformulation.

Furthermore, MQT QUBOMaker supports a variety of different encodings. End users can easily switch between the encodings for evaluation purposes without any additional effort, a task that would otherwise require a large amount of tedious mathematical reformulation.

Currently, MQT QUBOMaker provides the following submodule:

- [_Pathfinder_](./src/mqt/qubomaker/pathfinder/README.md): This submodule provides a specialization of the QUBOMaker class for the solution of optimization problems involving the search for paths in a directed graph. It provides a large set of pathfinding-related constraints that are used to define individual problem instances.

The _Pathfinder_ submodule also has a supporting [GUI](https://cda-tum.github.io/mqt-qubomaker/) to further facilitate its use.

If you have any questions, feel free to create a [discussion](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qubomaker/discussions) or an [issue](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qubomaker/issues) on [GitHub](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qubomaker).

## Getting Started

`mqt-qubomaker` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qubomaker/).

```console
(venv) $ pip install mqt.qubomaker
```

The following code gives an example of the usage with the `pathfinder` submodule:

```python3
import mqt.qubomaker as qm
import mqt.qubomaker.pathfinder as pf

# define an example graph to investigate.
graph = qm.Graph.from_adjacency_matrix(
    [
        [0, 1, 3, 4],
        [2, 0, 4, 2],
        [1, 5, 0, 3],
        [3, 8, 1, 0],
    ]
)

# select the settings for the QUBO formulation.
settings = pf.PathFindingQuboGeneratorSettings(
    encoding_type=pf.EncodingType.ONE_HOT, n_paths=1, max_path_length=4, loops=True
)

# define the generator to be used for the QUBO formulation.
generator = pf.PathFindingQuboGenerator(
    objective_function=pf.MinimizePathLength(path_ids=[1]),
    graph=graph,
    settings=settings,
)

# add the constraints that define the problem instance.
generator.add_constraint(pf.PathIsValid(path_ids=[1]))
generator.add_constraint(
    pf.PathContainsVerticesExactlyOnce(vertex_ids=graph.all_vertices, path_ids=[1])
)

# generate and view the QUBO formulation as a QUBO matrix.
print(generator.construct_qubo_matrix())
```
