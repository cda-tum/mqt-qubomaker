"""A package for generating QUBO formulations automatically from a set of constraints QUBOs for different problem classes.

It allows users to create a `QUBOGenerator` object, and gradually add penalty terms and constraints to it.
When done, the object can be used to construct a QUBO formulation of the project on multiple granularity levels.

## Available Subpackages
- `pathfinder`: This module implements the pathfinding functionalities of the QUBOMaker.
